Isolation order checklist
Check connectivity first, including DNS, gateway reachability, and service availability.
Validate identity and access: account status, MFA, group or role membership, license assignment, token age.
Inspect endpoint state for time sync, disk and memory health, recent updates, and agent status.
Review the client application version, cached credentials, profile data, and safe mode results.
Confirm service or back-end health, outages, throttling alerts, and policy drift indicators.
Verify data and permissions such as ACLs, holds, and quotas.
